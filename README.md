# Centralized-Reporting-Page
The Reporting Center is a web application that collects links from various reporting platforms such as Power BI, Tableau, and others. These links are stored in a SQL Server database for later access and use. The application was developed using Flask as the server-side framework, and CSS and HTML for the client-side.

Users can access the application from any device with an internet connection to search for and access the reports they need. Additionally, the application also allows for the creation of custom reports using data from the SQL Server database.

The main objective of the Reporting Center is to facilitate access to information for users within the company and improve data-driven decision-making. The application also aims to reduce the time users spend searching for reports on different platforms and centralize information in one place.
